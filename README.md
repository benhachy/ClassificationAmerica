# Predicting the Geographical Origin using Genetic Markers
The goal of this project is to use **genetic markers** to predict **the geographical origin** of an individual, which can be “*North America*”, “*Central America*”, or “*South America*”. We will compare the results of classification using three approaches:
* **multinomial regression** (i.e. *logistic regression with more than two classes*) using the **nnet** package in R. 
* **linear discriminant analysis** (*LDA*) using the **class** library in R.
* **naive Bayes classifier** using the **naivebayes** R library.

This project has been done using the **R programming language** in a group of three people, at *ENSIMAG*.
