# ClassificationAmerica
The goal of this practical session is to use genetic markers to predict the geographical origin of an individual, which can be “North America”, “Central America”, or “South America”. We will compare the results of classification using three approaches:
* multinomial regression (i.e. logistic regression with more than two classes)
* linear discriminant analysis (LDA) 
* naive Bayes classifier

This project has been done in a group of three people, at ENSIMAG.
